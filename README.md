# RLWE based Zero-Knowledge for commitments

This github provides the implementation of the lattice-based post-quantum commitment scheme introduced by Mart√≠nez and Morillo in https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1486.

Our implementation is very flexible and its parameters can be adjusted to obtain a trade-off between speed and memory usage, demonstrating that the underlying lattice-based techniques are suitable for practical use.
